snes cic implementation with FPGA FireAnt board

Personally I got this board from Mouser, but the board comes without the packaging that contains the serial number that is normally required to register the device with Efinix (https://www.efinixinc.com/products-efinity.html). I contacted them to create an account in order to download the IDE and have access to support.

FireAnt on the right connected to SMW PCB. Little LED next to USB conenctor is on showing that reset has been released. On the left of the image, there is PIC16F that I used to compare the outputs.
